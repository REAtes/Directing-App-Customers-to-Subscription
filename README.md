# Project Title: Directing Customers to Subscription Products through App Behavior Analysis

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to convert free users of a financial tracking app into paid members. This conversion will be achieved by building a model that identifies users who are unlikely to enroll in the paid version of the app.

## Problem Statement
The project focuses on a fintech company offering both free and paid versions of a financial tracking app. The challenge is to develop a model capable of pinpointing users who are less likely to upgrade to the paid version. This way, the company can strategically allocate its resources, directing marketing efforts toward users who are more likely to convert to paid membership.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Dataset Exploration:
- Explore the provided dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Identify key features and gain insights into the nature of the data.

### 2. Data Visualization:
- Visualize relevant data patterns and distributions.
- Gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between different variables.

### 3. Feature Engineering:
- Manipulate and transform data to create meaningful features.
- Enhance the dataset to improve model performance.

### 4. Label Encoding - Binary Encoding & One-Hot Encoding:
- Encode categorical variables using both binary encoding and one-hot encoding techniques.
- Prepare the data for model training by converting categorical features into a suitable format.

### 5. Base Models:
- Develop initial machine learning models to establish a baseline performance.
- Evaluate the models to understand their predictive capabilities.

### 6. Hyperparameter Optimization:
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve overall performance.
- Use optimization techniques to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

### 7. SHAP Summary Plot:
- Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret and explain model predictions.
- Generate summary plots to understand the impact of different features on the model's decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project aims to address the challenge of converting free users to paid members through app behavior analysis. By following a systematic workflow, including dataset exploration, data visualization, feature engineering, and model building, the goal is to create an effective predictive model. The README provides an overview of each step involved in the project, highlighting the key tasks and methodologies employed to achieve the desired outcome.
